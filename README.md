# Definition :-

Smart Grid is an Electrical Grid with Automation, Communication and IT systems that can monitor power flows from points of generation to points of consumption and control the power flow in both direction.

Smart grid solutions helps to monitor, measure and control power flows in real time that can contribute to identification of losses and thereby appropriate technical and managerial actions can be taken to arrest the losses.

Smart grid solutions can contribute to reduction of T&D losses(electricity that is generated but does not reach intended customers), Peak load management, improved quality of Service, increased reliability, better asset management, renewable integration, better accessibility to electricity etc. and also lead to self-healing grids.

Smart Grids can be achieved by implementing efficient transmission & distribution systems, system operations, consumer integration and renewable integration.

# Upgrading the Electrical Grid (Component):-

Upgrades to the electrical grid allow each critical component, such as substations and transformers, if a critical component such as a transformer was overloaded or overheating, a message would go out to a monitoring station. When this information is received, the power could be rerouted until the transformer is replaced.

# 1. Advanced Meter Infrastructure
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) facilitates monitoring and measurement of consumer information through Smart Meters installed at customer. AMI consists of new sensors, communication networks, and data management systems that are used to modernize the electrical grid and provide new capabilities to utilities and customers.Real-time monitoring and sensing are an essential component of a smart grid.

# 2. Distributed Power Generation
Distributed power generation is the use of small-scale power generation technologies located close to the loads that are being served. Distributed power generation systems can include PV arrays, wind turbines, biodiesel generators, and other relatively small-scale power systems.

# 3. Interactive Distributed Generation
With interactive distributed generation, utility customers are served by both the centralized power plant and the power exported from interconnected distribution generators.

# 4. Phasor Measurements
A phasor measurement unit (PMU) is a device that measures electrical waveforms on the electrical grid, As more power is delivered through the current electrical grid, renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind are raising concerns on how to maintain electrical grid balance and stability.

# 5. Peak Load Management
The peak management refers to controlling the demand and matching it to the available supply at the instant of peak. The peak management function shall take inputs from SCADA for power availability and volume of shortage.

# 6. Digital Relays
Digital relays use microprocessors to measure power (currents and voltage) and process this information through their internal logic to control the operation of a circuit breaker.

# Features of Smart Grid
Smart grid has several positive features that give direct benefit to consumers:

Real time monitoring.
Automated outage management and faster restoration.
Dynamic pricing mechanisms.
Incentivize consumers to alter usage during different times of day based on pricing signals.
Better energy management.
In-house displays.
Web portals and mobile apps.
Track and manage energy usage.
Opportunities to reduce and conserve electricity etc.

Smart Grid will also facilitate distributed generation, especially the roof top solar generation, by allowing movement and measurement of energy in both directions using control systems and net metering that will help “prosumers” i.e. the consumers who both produce and consume electricity, to safely connect to the grid.

# Benefits of Smart Grid Deployments
Several groups of the society are provided with multiple benefits through the Smart Grid implementations. Such include utility, customers and the regulators while some of the benefits include:

Reduction of T&D losses.
Peak load management, improved QoS and reliability.
Reduction in power purchase cost.
Better asset management.
Increased grid visibility and self-healing grids.
Renewable integration and accessibility to electricity.
Increased options such as ToU tariff, DR programs, net metering.
Satisfied customers and financially sound utilities etc.
